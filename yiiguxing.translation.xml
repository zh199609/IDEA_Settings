      <item value="If you're unsure why you're getting above error read on. Due to the nature of the syntax above problem might occur because: 1. This exception might occur in wrongly written multi-threaded tests. Please refer to Mockito FAQ on limitations of concurrency testing. 2. A spy is stubbed using when(spy.foo()).then() syntax. It is safer to stub spies - - with doReturn|Throw() family of methods. More in javadocs for Mockito.spy() method." />

Implementations can use all sorts of different execution strategies, such as: synchronous, asynchronous, using a thread pool, and more. Equivalent to JDK 1.5's Executor interface; extending it now in Spring 3.0, so that clients may declare a dependency on an Executor and receive any TaskExecutor implementation. This interface remains separate from the standard Executor interface mainly for backwards compatibility with JDK 1.4 in Spring 2.x." />
