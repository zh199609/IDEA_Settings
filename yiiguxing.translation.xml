For parallel stream pipelines, the combiner function operates by merging the keys from one map into another, which can be an expensive operation. If it is not required that results are merged into the Map in encounter order, using toConcurrentMap(Function, Function, BinaryOperator) may offer better parallel performance." />

      <item value="Annotation that binds a method parameter or method return value to a named model attribute, exposed to a web view. Supported for controller classes with @RequestMapping methods. Can be used to expose command objects to a web view, using specific attribute names, through annotating corresponding parameters of an @RequestMapping method. Can also be used to expose reference data to a web view through annotating accessor methods in a controller class with @RequestMapping methods. Such accessor methods are allowed to have any arguments that @RequestMapping methods support, returning the model attribute value to expose. Note however that reference data and all other model content is not available to web views when request processing results in an Exception since the exception could be raised at any time making the content of the model unreliable. For this reason @ExceptionHandler methods do not provide access to a Model argument." />

It handles HTTP connections, leaving application code to provide URLs (with possible template variables) and extract results. Note: by default the RestTemplate relies on standard JDK facilities to establish HTTP connections. You can switch to use a different HTTP library such as Apache HttpComponents, Netty, and OkHttp through the setRequestFactory property. The main entry points of this template are the methods named after the six main HTTP methods:" />

It is safer to stub spies - - with doReturn|Throw() family of methods. More in javadocs for Mockito.spy() method." />
