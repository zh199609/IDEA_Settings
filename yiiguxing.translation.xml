      <item value="Table initialization and resizing control. When negative, the table is being initialized or resized: -1 for initialization, else -(1 + the number of active resizing threads). Otherwise, when table is null, holds the initial table size to use upon creation, or 0 for default. After initialization, holds the next element count value upon which to resize the table" />

The value can be retrieved by calling the get method with a key that is equal to the original key. Params: key – key with which the specified value is to be associated value – value to be associated with the specified key Returns: the previous value associated with key, or null if there was no mapping for key Throws: NullPointerException – if the specified key or value is null" />
      <item value="Key-value entry. This class is never exported out as a user-mutable Map.Entry (i.e., one supporting setValue; see MapEntry below), but can be used for read-only traversals used in bulk tasks. Subclasses of Node with a negative hash field are special, and contain null keys and values (but are never exported). Otherwise, keys and vals are never null." />
      <item value="A task that returns a result and may throw an exception. Implementors define a single method with no arguments called call. The Callable interface is similar to Runnable, in that both are designed for classes whose instances are potentially executed by another thread. A Runnable, however, does not return a result and cannot throw a checked exception. The Executors class contains utility methods to convert from other common forms to Callable" />

      <item value="Returns a composed function that first applies this function to its input, and then applies the after function to the result. If evaluation of either function throws an exception, it is relayed to the caller of the composed function." />
      <item value="Spring's central class for synchronous client-side HTTP access. It simplifies communication with HTTP servers, and enforces RESTful principles. It handles HTTP connections, leaving application code to provide URLs (with possible template variables) and extract results. Note: by default the RestTemplate relies on standard JDK facilities to establish HTTP connections. You can switch to use a different HTTP library such as Apache HttpComponents, Netty, and OkHttp through the setRequestFactory property. The main entry points of this template are the methods named after the six main HTTP methods:" />
      <item value="Returns whether any elements of this stream match the provided predicate. May not evaluate the predicate on all elements if not necessary for determining the result. If the stream is empty then false is returned and the predicate is not evaluated." />

      <item value="If you're unsure why you're getting above error read on. Due to the nature of the syntax above problem might occur because: 1. This exception might occur in wrongly written multi-threaded tests. Please refer to Mockito FAQ on limitations of concurrency testing. 2. A spy is stubbed using when(spy.foo()).then() syntax. It is safer to stub spies - - with doReturn|Throw() family of methods. More in javadocs for Mockito.spy() method." />

      <item value="The value is optional and represents an order value as defined in the Ordered interface. Lower values have higher priority. The default value is Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE, indicating lowest priority (losing to any other specified order value)." />

      <item value="Annotation-based ordering is supported for specific kinds of components only — for example, for annotation-based AspectJ aspects. Ordering strategies within the Spring container, on the other hand, are typically based on the Ordered interface in order to allow for programmatically configurable ordering of each instance." />

      <item value="Simple task executor interface that abstracts the execution of a Runnable. Implementations can use all sorts of different execution strategies, such as: synchronous, asynchronous, using a thread pool, and more. Equivalent to JDK 1.5's Executor interface; extending it now in Spring 3.0, so that clients may declare a dependency on an Executor and receive any TaskExecutor implementation. This interface remains separate from the standard Executor interface mainly for backwards compatibility with JDK 1.4 in Spring 2.x." />
